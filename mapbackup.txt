Map Making Instructions:

-Replace the letters above with capital W for walls, and a capital T for the treasure room.
-Any other letter is read as a blank space on the map and will be automatically populated with monsters and items.
- Save this map file as map.txt when you are done.
- Starting the game will automatically load this map as the first map.

Have fun!
